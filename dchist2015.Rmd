#Institutionalizing Knowledge in Early Washington D.C.  

In Democracy in America, Alexander de Tocqueville observed that “In democratic countries the science of association is the mother of science; the progress of all the rest depends upon the progress it has made.” Tocqueville noted that Americans formed numerous associations for distinct purposes and whose goals included establishing schools and churches, and spreading knowledge through the publication of information of interest to like-minded citizens.  The residents of the District of Columbia, America’s federal city, sought to create a thriving metropolis crowded with a vibrant and extensive community of scholars. Many hoped a national institution would materialize to promote the expansion of knowledge and learning. This paper explores the purpose and composition of the myriad societies in the early federal city, especially scientific, literary and proto-professional societies, 1815-1850. This paper examines the shared relationships between these groups using computational tools and methods to develop network analysis using society membership lists.

##Introduction

In addition to being the site for the national government, the District of Columbia was the home of many different societies dedicated to the collection and dissemination of useful knowledge. Typically, scholars characterize these institutions as localized groups with grand designs limited by parochial insights and miserly pocketbooks. This paper seeks to explore the make-up of the local institutions and to utilize computational methods to examine if these local institutions were more cosmopolitan in nature.

###Membership Lists
<h3>Membership Rolls: Collecting Data</h3>
Finding and collecting data from the various organizations that existed in Early Washington is a tedious project and fraught with challenges. There are limited archival sources from the organizations themselves. Some of the more complete examples include the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences and its successor the National Institution (Institute) for the Promotion of Science both available in the Smithsonian Archives. These particular institutions have membership books that compiled the membership lists at different times in their existence. Since these institutions counted many leading citizens of the republic as members and they scholars identify them as predecessors of the Smithsonian many of their records survived. In other cases like the Medical Society of the District of Columbia’s records are at the National Library of Medicine. Occasionally organizations published the names of their membership in their journals or other proceedings such as the Columbian Agricultural Society.  Most typically, there seem to be hints or references to the associations in scattered newspaper accounts, memoirs, or government records. Despite the restrictions of the source pool, there are ways to utilize the existing data to ask new questions from old sources. This paper seeks to demonstrate the importance of such lists to scholars in order to help demonstrate how computational methods can provide new uses to old sources. Additionally, communicating these methods may help uncover more relevant source pools for scholars to mine.
